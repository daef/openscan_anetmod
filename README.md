I wanted to build the openscan.eu scanner with some spare parts.

Not only did I replace the arduino pro mini with an uno (since I had one left over),
but I also reused the lcd/button board from an old Anet A8 printer.

Since the display doesn't use I2C and the buttons share one pin I had to adapt the source a bit.
